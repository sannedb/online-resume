                <p>I think it would be cool to overlap some sections? As if there is a lot to see even
                    though there really isn't, lol! Just make sure to add something you are proud of
                    for at least every language you have done so far (except maybe C lol).

                    For Swift, use e.g. Flappy Box gifs. For Python, maybe use the code you wrote for adventure?
                    For C++, you can use the code you wrote for the Knights' problem, etc. And maybe you can add
                    the code in a way where it looks like you opened VSC!
